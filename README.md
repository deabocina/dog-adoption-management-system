## Key Features
### Prospective Adopters Features
Prospective adopters can create accounts, search for dogs, submit adoption applications and receive notifications about their applications.
- **Filter:** Provide a filter functionality for adopters to find dogs based on criteria like breed, age, and gender. Users can easily narrow down their search to find dogs that match their preferences.
- **Adoption Application:** Enable adopters to complete adoption applications, including essential information about themselves and their chosen dog. This streamlines the application process and helps staff assess suitability.
- **Profile Editing:** Allow users to edit their profiles, updating contact information or preferences as needed. This ensures that adopters can keep their information current.
- **Volunteer Option:** Integrate a feature that allows adopters to express interest in volunteering. This provides an avenue for adopters to contribute to the well-being of the shelter beyond the adoption process.
- **Contract Status Tracking:** Enable adopters to track the status of their adoption contracts. This feature keeps adopters informed about the progress of the necessary paperwork, ensuring transparency and clarity in the adoption process.
- #### Volunteer Management: 
  The system allows the management of volunteers who are willing to help the shelter in various capacities, including:
    - **Food Management**: Volunteers can sign up to provide food for the dogs to ensure consistent and appropriate care.
    - **Walking and Exercise**: Volunteers can manage dog walking and exercise routines to keep the dogs active and healthy.
    - **Cleaning and Maintenance**: Volunteers can sign up for cleaning shifts to ensure the shelter's cleanliness and hygiene.
    - **Fostering**: Temporary adoption functionality is included for cases where adopters may only be able to provide temporary care to a dog.
     - **Transportation**: Volunteers can sign up for transportation roles to efficiently move animals between locations.

### Staff Features
Staff members can log in to manage dog records, review adoption applications and send email notifications.
- **Admin Panel:** Create an admin panel for staff to manage dog records, applications and approvals efficiently.
- **Adoption Listings:** Allow staff to add new dogs to the database and set their adoption status. Dogs available for adoption are visible to prospective adopters.
- **Approval Process:** Enable staff members to review adoption applications, contact adopters and approve or deny adoptions. Update the dog's status to "Adopted" upon approval.
- **Vaccine Management:** Implement a vaccine management system within the admin panel, allowing staff to track and update the vaccination status of each dog. This ensures that all dogs in the shelter receive necessary vaccinations for their well-being.
- **Volunteer Management:** Expand the admin panel to include volunteer management features, allowing staff to coordinate and oversee volunteer activities. This includes assigning tasks, tracking volunteer hours, and recognizing volunteer contributions.

### Admin Features
As the highest level of authority, administrators have access to a comprehensive set of features, encompassing all functionalities available to staff members, along with additional capabilities.
- **User Roles and Permissions:** Admins can manage user roles and permissions, assigning distinct access levels for staff members and other administrators. This ensures a secure and controlled environment.
